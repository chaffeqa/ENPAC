The common dolly has been rattling around industrial plants for 200 years virtually unchanged in design and function. It has been a good tool, but not efficient enough. Poly-Dolly, the multi-functional two wheel dispensing station, takes the dolly out of the Industrial Revolution and into the 21st Century.

With Poly-Dolly, mobile dispensing is no longer a cumbersome, risky business. It transports 55-gallon drums with ease, tilts to become an efficient self-dispensing station, and acts as its own secondary containment unit. By reducing unnecessary and dangerous drum handling, Poly-Dolly protects workers, improves efficiency and helps improve profits.

Made of long-lasting tough polyethylene, Poly-Dolly is strong enough to withstand daily bumps and scuffs and will not rust or corrode. That is why companies are saying: “Goodbye dolly. Hello Poly-Dolly.”

ENP D225,ENSORB™ Super Absorbent,ENP D225,Sorbents,"ENSORB Super Absorbent™ has unlimited uses. Immediately absorbing liquids of any viscosity, leaving surfaces clean and dry.


Features:
• 15 to 20 times the absorption capacity of clay-based products.
• Extraordinary versatility in absorbing any kind of liquid or semi-liquid on contact and permanently encapsulates absorbed materials. This includes all animal, vegetable, mineral, petroleum, and chemical liquids*.
• Virtually unlimited uses as a dry absorbent that is safe in all applications.
• Picks up all liquids, of any viscosity, off any hard surface, leaving that surface clean and dry.
• Turns the spilled liquid into a solid that can be disposed of easily.
• Lightweight and simple to use, it dramatically reduces clean up costs, as well as the ever-increasing costs of disposal.
• Not injurious to soil, cement, asphalt, tile, plants, animals, or humans.
• Contains no reactive chemicals, is not toxic, flammable, or biodegradable, and is environmentally safe and friendly.","ENSORB™ Super Absorbent is a non-toxic, non-flammable, environmentally safe and friendly, lightweight and powerful substance that can absorb and hold all liquids* while leaving little or no residue. Less than half a pound of ENSORB™ Super Absorbent can completely absorb one quart of motor oil without leaving any residue to re-clean. Clay, earth, and sand products require 15 pounds of material to absorb the same amount and would leave a slippery residue.

ENSORB™ Super Absorbent requires far less absorbent to capture a spill, resulting in greatly reduced disposal costs. ENSORB™ Super Absorbent works on all animal, vegetable, mineral, petroleum based or semi-liquid spills.

ENSORB™ Super Absorbent meets or exceeds all OSHA and EPA requirements for health and safety. Unlike Kitty litter products that contain ""Crystalline"" Silica, ENSORB Super Absorbent™ does not, under OSHA standards, qualify as a carcinogen, or as a substance causing silicosis, a lung disease.

ENSORB™ Super Absorbent requires far less absorbent to capture a spill, resulting in greatly reduced disposal costs. ENSORB Super Absorbent™ is non-injurious to most surfaces including cement, asphalt, tile, carpet. ENSORB Super Absorbent™ leaves no residue, therefore no slips or falls.

ENSORB™ Super Absorbent will save money on shipping, storing and disposal. It's light weight and high absorbency will make it easier to handle (less work-comp claims)

ENPD208CS,ENSORB™ Super Absorbent,ENPD208CS,Sorbents,"ENSORB Super Absorbent™ has unlimited uses. Immediately absorbing liquids of any viscosity, leaving surfaces clean and dry.


Features:
• 15 to 20 times the absorption capacity of clay-based products.
• Extraordinary versatility in absorbing any kind of liquid or semi-liquid on contact and permanently encapsulates absorbed materials. This includes all animal, vegetable, mineral, petroleum, and chemical liquids*.
• Virtually unlimited uses as a dry absorbent that is safe in all applications.
• Picks up all liquids, of any viscosity, off any hard surface, leaving that surface clean and dry.
• Turns the spilled liquid into a solid that can be disposed of easily.
• Lightweight and simple to use, it dramatically reduces clean up costs, as well as the ever-increasing costs of disposal.
• Not injurious to soil, cement, asphalt, tile, plants, animals, or humans.
• Contains no reactive chemicals, is not toxic, flammable, or biodegradable, and is environmentally safe and friendly.","ENSORB™ Super Absorbent is a non-toxic, non-flammable, environmentally safe and friendly, lightweight and powerful substance that can absorb and hold all liquids* while leaving little or no residue. Less than half a pound of ENSORB™ Super Absorbent can completely absorb one quart of motor oil without leaving any residue to re-clean. Clay, earth, and sand products require 15 pounds of material to absorb the same amount and would leave a slippery residue.

ENSORB™ Super Absorbent requires far less absorbent to capture a spill, resulting in greatly reduced disposal costs. ENSORB™ Super Absorbent works on all animal, vegetable, mineral, petroleum based or semi-liquid spills.

ENSORB™ Super Absorbent meets or exceeds all OSHA and EPA requirements for health and safety. Unlike Kitty litter products that contain ""Crystalline"" Silica, ENSORB Super Absorbent™ does not, under OSHA standards, qualify as a carcinogen, or as a substance causing silicosis, a lung disease.

ENSORB™ Super Absorbent requires far less absorbent to capture a spill, resulting in greatly reduced disposal costs. ENSORB Super Absorbent™ is non-injurious to most surfaces including cement, asphalt, tile, carpet. ENSORB Super Absorbent™ leaves no residue, therefore no slips or falls.

ENSORB™ Super Absorbent will save money on shipping, storing and disposal. It's light weight and high absorbency will make it easier to handle (less work-comp claims)

","ChemKlenz is a proprietary formulation of non-toxic, environmentally safe metal oxides for neutralizing a wide range of toxic chemicals. The ChemKlenz formulation is non-flammable, non-corrosive and significantly reduces both liquid and vapor hazards. Since the dry powder neutralizes threats upon contact, on-site incident management and clean up times are reduced.

ChemKlenz works quickly to significantly reduce hazards associated with common industrial chemicals including: acids, acidic/caustic gases, organic compounds, phosphorus and sulfur compounds, and many industrial solvents. By the nature of ChemKlenz’s innovative chemistry, hazards are chemically bound to the surface of the powder minimizing off-gassing.
